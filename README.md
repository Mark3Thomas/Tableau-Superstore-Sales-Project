# Superstore Sales Insights Dashboard (Excel)

Every business loves rising sales — until they realize profits aren’t following.

This dashboard breaks down **why growth doesn’t always equal profitability** and uncovers the levers executives can pull to fix it. Built in Excel using pivot tables, DAX-style measures, slicers, and a clean layout designed for quick decision-making.


## 🔍 Project Overview
I built this analysis to answer one question every business eventually faces:
**“We’re selling more… so why are we earning less?”**

Using the Tableau Superstore dataset, I transformed thousands of rows of raw transactions into a compact, executive-ready dashboard revealing:
- revenue patterns,
- profit leakage,
- discount misuse,
- product-level losses,
- shipping inefficiencies,
- and customer behaviour shifts.

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- clean and structure data,
- build analytical models,
- design intuitive dashboards,
- extract decision-ready insights,
- and communicate business recommendations clearly.


## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed
- **Total Sales**
- **Total Profit**
- **Profit Margin %**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Order Count**
- **Subcategory Profitability**
- **Discount Impact on Profit**


## 📈 Core Insights (Business-Ready)
### **1️⃣ Profit margin is falling despite strong sales growth**  
Sales grew significantly, but profit margin **slipped by 0.7%**, meaning revenue growth is masking underlying cost/discount issues.

### **2️⃣ Discounts above 15% consistently destroy profit**  
The scatterplot shows a clear threshold:  
After ~15% discount, **margins turn negative**.  
This is the biggest driver of profit leakage.

### **3️⃣ Some product subcategories are loss-makers**  
Tables, Bookcases, and Machines are consistently unprofitable — even with high sales volume.  
This points to pricing issues, supplier cost problems, or discount abuse.

### **4️⃣ High-margin categories are being under-marketed**  
Paper, Envelopes, Labels, and Phones deliver the **strongest margins** but receive a smaller share of overall sales.

### **5️⃣ AOV (Average Order Value) dropped**  
This means customers are buying more frequently but spending less on each order.


## 🛠 Recommendations (What a CEO Should Do Next)

### **1. Cap discounts at 15%**
Anything above that becomes a loss.  
Implement discount approval limits or tighten promo rules.

### **2. Reprice or discontinue loss-making subcategories**
Tables & Bookcases should be reviewed immediately.  
Either renegotiate supplier prices or adjust selling price.

### **3. Promote high-margin categories**
Push Paper, Labels, Phones, and Envelopes through:
- bundle offers  
- homepage placement  
- email targeting  
- upsells  

### **4. Increase AOV**
Introduce:
- free shipping thresholds,  
- minimum order incentives,  
- product bundles.

### **5. Re-evaluate shipping methods**
Standard Class orders bring volume but squeeze profit.  
Introduce shipping-based pricing or minimum order requirements.
